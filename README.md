# Dating_app

Most of us, at some point, have faced the frustration of not finding suitable matches on current dating apps. Even if we do find some, they often turn out to be either not genuine or completely unaffordable.

In this scenario, there's a great opportunity to build a new kind of dating app — one that uses personality-based questionnaires to build deeper, more accurate user profiles. This will help users find better matches based on character compatibility rather than just looks or superficial interests.

There is already an app called "Boo" that follows this model to some extent, but users still report issues. This gives us a chance to improve upon that concept and create an app that is more reliable, user-friendly, and tailored to real user needs.

To ensure authenticity, all users must go through a verification process before creating a profile. This app can serve both purposes: helping users find meaningful friendships or romantic connections.

As for monetization, the app will initially be free to use so that users can explore its full potential without barriers. Once it gains popularity and trust, we can introduce monetization in a way that doesn’t affect the user experience.

By focusing on genuine profiles, character-based matchmaking, and ease of use, this app can truly stand out and make a meaningful impact in the dating space.
